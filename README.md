# oh hello there, you've landed on an obscure user profile

I'm Juno Kreisler. Originally from Latvia, I'm currently in my last year of Bachelor's in Biology at ETH Zürich in Switzerland.
The heavily theoretical, yet also often engineering-like mindset presented to me over the course of my studies 
has inspired me to delve into Computational Biology, which is also the Master's degree that I'm enrolling myself in after my Bachelor's. 

My greatest life goal would be designing and analyzing synthetic life *in silico*. But that's probably for the second half of this century.
Meanwhile, I want to become proficient in Python, R, C++, Java, Matlab, HTML/CSS/JS and SQL.

## me be doing some other things sometimes

I'm also interested in small-scale game development... 
<font size=0.1337>
as well as music theory, languages, arts and crafts, cooking, soccer and historical political theories 
(but this place isn't necessarily the best for displaying that)
</font>. My interests are very broad, so I tend to get lost in many big and small, 
often very unrelated ideas and projects. I also to overfill my day with various activities which leave little time to work on things 
that can go here... sometimes, though, I do get a boost in motivation and muster something up. 

## gggg (gurl gotta git[hub] gud)

I'm still very much a noob at the stuff that I'm supposed to be putting out here. This place will serve, first and foremost, 
as a repository of code I write out of personal interest, as well as code that builds on or remasters certain projects of mine 
from university courses. Later it would be cool to share some game code too.

## gotta be starting something, NOW

Currently, I'm practicing/learning to implement some general & bioinformatic algorithms in Python,
while also developing some very basic minigames using Pygame. 
My learning progress can be viewed at [mini_bioinf](https://github.com/junokreisler/mini_bioinf).
Some random small programs are reposited in [smallthings](https://github.com/junokreisler/smallthings).
For bigger projects, I'll use their own repos, which I'll link as soon as they being to hold something inside.

## and then?

For now, I'm not going to discuss further stuff that might be in the works after I'm done with current plans.
Let's see where all of this leads me.
